 ## Classes do, Struct don't
 
 - Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
 - Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.
 - Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.
 - Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.
